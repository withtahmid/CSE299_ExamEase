							Specifications (SDS). Project managers use this document to comprehensively plan projects
							and select suitable development strategies like agile or waterfall, prioritizing high-impact
							use cases to optimize resource utilization.

							Quality assurance teams engineer test plans based on the SRS requirements to verify software
							implementation aligns with client needs. During maintenance periods, this document acts as a
							fail-safe resource, providing insight into the software's purpose, scope, parameters, and
							objectives when the original team is unavailable. It's advisable to limit access to this
							document to software developers to ensure reliance on the SDS, thereby allowing the Quality
							Assurance team to detect design flaws or inefficiencies during testing. This enables
							iterative improvements in subsequent iterations.

							For effective comprehension, it's suggested to follow the order outlined in the "Table of
							Contents" of the SRS document.</p>

						<p class="sub-topic-heading">1.4 Product Scope</p>
						<p class="sub-topic-content">
							The "Exam-Ease" system facilitates the opportunity for individuals to engage in online
							examination procedures. This software framework caters to two distinct user categories:
							Faculty and students. A primary aim of this software is to establish an online platform that
							serves as a substitute for traditional in-person exams. Nonetheless, the principal
							distinguishing factor of this software lies in its Micro-Viva functionality and
							Auto-Proctoring system.

							The Micro-Viva feature involves presenting candidates with Faculty-generated questions in
							the form of voice recordings. In response, students utilize an integrated system feature to
							record their vocal responses for the Micro-Viva questions. On the other hand, the
							Auto-Proctoring system utilizes facial recognition technology to verify the identity of the
							student undertaking the examination and to identify any potentially suspicious activities.

							Ensuring robust security measures, the software diligently safeguards against any
							inadvertent disclosure of answers, thus maintaining the integrity of the examination system.
							Moreover, the software is compatible with various educational contexts, including learning
							management systems, educational institutions, and modern EdTech businesses. As a result, it
							can seamlessly integrate with these establishments or enterprises.

							This offering constitutes an element of the software engineering course evaluation during
							the summer academic term of 2023 at North South University. The concept for this project was
							put forth by a faculty member who took on the role of the "client." In turn, a group of
							students assumed the role of an imaginative software firm to execute the tasks. The
							resultant product materializes as a novel, standalone system, distinct from both any
							existing product lineage and any preexisting system it doesn't supplant.

							The product should enable users to register within the system using a valid email address.
							During the registration process, users will select their role as either a faculty member or
							a student. Faculty members possess the authorization to establish new cohorts and include
							students by using their respective email addresses. In cases where the added email address
							is not yet registered within the system, an invitation will be dispatched to that email
							address.

							Faculty members are empowered to create exams within a cohort, with each exam having the
							capacity to encompass multiple questions. Students who have been included in a cohort are
							eligible to participate in the exams. The exams can be scheduled with flexibility and set to
							a specific duration. Upon exam completion, the system will undertake automated exam grading
							and generate an exam summary for each student. This summary might include indications of
							tab-switching, communication with others, absence in front of the camera, and similar
							factors.

							Faculty members retain the ability to release the exam scores. Following the release of
							scores, students have the option to raise disputes regarding their exam results, attaching
							specific comments. In response, faculty members can proceed to manually re-evaluate the
							answers as necessary.

						<p class="sub-topic-content">
							Every user possesses the capability to log into the system by using a valid email address.
							Exclusive to faculty members is the ability to initiate the creation of an exam cohort.
							Within each established exam cohort, faculty members, in addition to including candidates
							via email, hold the privilege to design multiple examinations. Moreover, within each exam,
							faculties can incorporate multiple-choice questions (MCQs), short-text queries, and
							Micro-viva questions. They can also readjust student scores and furnish assessment details
							such as availability date-time and duration.
							<br>
							In instances where a student added to a cohort isn't already registered in the Exam-Ease
							system, they will receive an invitation link for registration and automatically be
							integrated into the cohort. MCQs encompass standard multiple-choice questions, which may
							involve multiple correct answers. In such cases, candidates need to select all applicable
							answers to secure points for the question. Short-text answers require students to type out
							their responses.
							<br>
							Viva questions and responses exclusively employ voice recordings. Both evaluators and
							candidates have the capability to record their voices or listen to previously recorded
							content within the software's provided user interface. Faculty members will record their
							voices while adding micro-viva questions or specifying correct micro-viva answers. During
							assessments, candidates can listen to micro-viva questions and provide recorded voice
							answers. When evaluators need to adjust a candidate's assessment score, they can listen to
							micro-viva responses and review short-text and MCQ answers.
							<br>
							The system undertakes automated assessment grading and generates a summary of the exam
							results for each student, including indicators of suspicious activity. Following the exam's
							conclusion, faculty members publish the grades. Students are empowered to initiate a dispute
							for a specific examination, attaching requisite comments for manual evaluation.
							Subsequently, faculty members can modify the marks accordingly.

						<p class="sub-topic-content">
							The software is designed to function on both web applications and Android devices. To ensure
							proper operation, the operating environment must include a functioning microphone for voice
							recording. It is advisable to avoid employing outdated versions of the Android operating
							system and instead opt for a relatively contemporary web browser.

						<p class="sub-topic-heading">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</p>
						<p class="sub-topic-content">
							The client's specifications entail the inclusion of short-text and voice answers within the
							software, with automatic evaluation. Consequently, the software's language scope is confined
							to English.
							<br>
							To ensure security, students are limited to participating in a particular exam of an
							assigned exam-cohort, designated by the respective faculty member of the cohort. Students
							are restricted from accessing exam cohorts that haven't been assigned to them by faculty
							members. This principle also applies to exams that aren't part of any exam cohort from the
							student's assigned cohort listings.
							<br>
							Moreover, to prevent any potential leakage of correct answers, questions and answer options
							presented to a student during an assessment will be randomly arranged. The integrity of the
							assessment process is maintained across all interfaces interacting with students. In the
							event that an exam's time limit is exceeded, the system will automatically detect this
							circumstance and promptly submit the student's answers.

							The software presupposes that users' devices are equipped with internet connectivity and can
							effectively utilize both the web application and Android app interfaces. Moreover, it is
							expected that users possess the necessary hardware components, such as a microphone for
							voice recording and a camera. The functionality of this software hinges on the utilization
							of external APIs like the Face-Verification API and machine learning-based speech-to-text
							APIs. Consequently, a significant aspect that sets this software apart rests on the
							effectiveness of these external machine learning models. It is assumed that these models
							perform adequately. It's worth noting that any discrepancies or alterations in these
							assumptions or dependencies can potentially impact the project's progression and outcome.

											designated role within the system, either as a Faculty member or a Student.
											Based on the chosen role, individuals are presented with a tailored
											registration form, wherein they provide essential details required to
											establish a new account (such as name and password). A crucial requirement
											for successful registration is the provision of a valid email address,
											ensuring authenticity and communication. It's noteworthy that each email
											account is associated with a singular system account, thereby preventing
											duplicity. Once the registration process is successfully completed, the
											system enforces a restriction against changing roles (e.g., transitioning
											from Student to Faculty), ensuring role consistency throughout the user's
